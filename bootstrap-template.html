The data used in the documents came from the New York State Department of Health.

                    <h3>COVID-19 in Onondaga County: A Rundown</h3>
                    <p>COVID-19 has been a household name since March 2020.  The pandemic was responsible for making close friends and family sick and unvisitable, ruining future plans for the summer, putting sports leagues on pause, closing down businesses, and so much more; but most notably, it changed our lives.</p>
                    <p>This story is newsworthy because it tracks the positive test count in Onondaga County.  Being able to track positive tests is crucial for giving Onondaga County (and every county) the best chance to combat the pandemic.  The dataset breaks down new positive tests for each day in Onondaga County for the first semester and a half of the 2021-2022 school year.</p>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-york-covid-cases.html" target="_blank"> this <i>NY Times Article</i></a>, Onondaga County ranks eighth in New York state cases per 100,000 people with about 26,350, and ranks thirteenth in NY State for fully vaccinated percentage, tallying in at 74%.

                    <h3>Notable Trends in Onondaga County and SU</h3>
                    <p>While observing at the dataset, multiple common trends stood out.  First, Syracuse University positive tests were almost always directly related with the Onondaga County case numbers.  Second, Holiday seasons often resulted in a spike of positive COVID tests in Onondaga County, and in most other counties.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/22/us/covid-data-holiday-averages.html" target="_blank">A <i>New York Times</i> article </a> supported this theory, as the trend was even more notable in the 2020-2021 holiday season.  However, according to the article, "The impact of holidays may be even more noticeable this time around, as illustrated by the recent Labor Day holiday, because states are reporting data less consistently than they did a year ago."</p>
                    <p>Thanksgiving break was the first notable spike in positive COVID-19 tests in Onondaga County.  For the 2021 Thanksgiving season, a spike in COVID-19 positive tests could be seen in the following of weeks after November 25th, which was when Thanksgiving landed.  Syracuse University's positive case numbers also had a notable increase during this time.  The total amount of active cases in the University community rose from 18 cases (November 29th) to 78 cases (December 7th).</p>
                    <p>Onondaga County was hit even harder for the December Holiday season.  At its peak, the county was looking at 2,084 positive tests and a 214.25% percent increase from the start of the month.  This resulted in December being the month with the highest percent change, as seen in the bottom chart.  As a precaution, Syracuse University pushed back the Spring semester's start date.  This was to give a bigger window for students and staff members to return to the University healthy.

                    <p>For the vast majority of the 2021-2022 school year, Syracuse students and staff have been behind masks.  The University, judging from past experience and NY State mandates, stayed compliant to all rules, in classrooms, sports games, and other events around campus.  Syracuse University also had a proper procedure for if someone were to test positive for COVID-19 at one of the campus testing centers.</p>
                    <p>Syracuse University Ambulance Staff Member Jack Qu provided insight about the process of transporting a person who tests positive.  "After someone gets tested at Barnes and tests positive," Qu explains, "they'll send a note to the student and the student will contact the Medical Transport at the Syracuse University Ambulance."  Qu continues, stating, "Dispatch will inform whoever is on the Ambulance shift that day of the patient's location.  Then, they'll pick them up and transport the patient to Sky Hall."

                    <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Currently, the cases per 100,000 people has steadily <a href="https://cnycentral.com/news/local/onondaga-county-continues-to-see-decline-in-new-covid-cases" target="_blank"> been dropping </a> in Onondaga County.  This is a good outlook for the end of the year, as it could lead to a more "normal" school year for the Fall 2022 semester and on.  Recently, Syracuse's Carrier Dome announced that masks are <a href="https://www.dailyorange.com/2022/03/fully-vaccinated-people-no-longer-required-masks-carrier-dome/" target="_blank"> no longer required </a> for fully vaccinated individuals; another instance of a positive outlook for next year.  </p>
